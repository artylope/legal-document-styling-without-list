Legal Document General Styling 

One of the challenges I have when developing websites quickly is that there will be legal pages (which has not much is happening except a wall of text) with alot of bullet points and sub-sections. The clauses might come with different list style types (roman numerals, letters, numbers, symbols) and may contain special sections that will require the list to reset and resume for the numbering. Also when styling lists using CSS, it was hard to control the counter-resets, list style types margins, text indentations etc. It gets hairy when you want to keep the indent beyond the first line. Legal document needs to be legible, it also needs to be updated and maintained over time but not regular enough for you to spend time fidgeting with these styling code. When new clauses are added, the numbering gets reordered again. Then it gets messy again.

I decided that styling these legal documents without using lists is more maintainable and extendable in the long run as I can just use whichever ordering system I want, without affecting styling code. So here goes. 


One wish I have is that I can make this WYSIWYG and/or Markdown and then I can export and use it in the projects and not worry about ugly styling in legal documents on the web.
